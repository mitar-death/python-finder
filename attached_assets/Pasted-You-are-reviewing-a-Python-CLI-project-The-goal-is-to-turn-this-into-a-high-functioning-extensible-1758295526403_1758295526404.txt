You are reviewing a Python CLI project.
The goal is to turn this into a high-functioning, extensible CLI app for business lead generation.

Hereâ€™s how the app should work:

Configuration via text files

providers.txt â†’ contains provider names and API keys (e.g., Yelp, Google).

email_finders.txt â†’ contains email finder API keys (e.g., Hunter.io, Snov.io).

proxies.txt â†’ contains proxy URLs. If this file is empty, skip proxy use.

queries.txt â†’ contains search queries.

If any file is missing or incorrectly formatted, show a useful, user-friendly error in the CLI.

Provider search phase

Loop through each provider (YelpProvider, GoogleProvider, etc.).

Fetch companies for each query.

Save the results.

If provider = Yelp, get the companyâ€™s URL, extract its domain, and save to a domains.txt.

If thereâ€™s an error with any provider, log the error clearly but move on to the next one.

Email finder phase

After a configurable delay (e.g., wait X seconds or minutes), run all enabled email finders against the domains list.

Use proxies if available.

If one finder fails, move to the next one.

CLI features

Use beautiful logging (rich/typer/loguru) instead of plain prints.

Clear separation of concerns:

Config loading

Providers (search)

Email finders

Output saving

Robust but not over-engineered.

Extensibility

Should be easy to add new providers (just drop in a new class extending BaseProvider).

Same for email finders (extend BaseFinder).

Minimal changes required to integrate new ones.
